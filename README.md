# dotvimrc

A simple yet effective _*vimrc*_ setup which is mostly pro-python. Also has enough ruby and rails setup. This obviously evolves over time based on needs and programming use-cases.

## Dependencies

  * YouCompleteMe - `brew install cmake` might be needed. Follow this with a `./install.py` within YouCompleteMe in vundle.
  * github login for using `vundle` and subsequent `:PluginInstall` cmd.
